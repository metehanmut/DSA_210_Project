# Hypothesis Test Result:
# Correlation Coefficient between Inflation Rate and Total Attendance: -0.3215

# p-value: 0.1255

# Correlation is negative (as inflation rises, attendance tends to fall slightly).

# But the p-value > 0.05, meaning this relationship is not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level.

# This hypothesis test explored the link between Turkeyâ€™s inflation rates and movie theater attendance from 2000 to 2023, finding 
# a negative but statistically insignificant correlation.
