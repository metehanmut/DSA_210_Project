Project Topic: "The Effect of the Economy of Turkey on Movie Theater Attendance"

In this project, I will analyze how the economic conditions in Turkey affect the number of people attending movie theaters. The hypothesis is that during periods of economic prosperity, people may have more disposable income, which could lead to higher movie theater attendance. Conversely, during economic downturns or crises, people may cut back on discretionary spending like entertainment. By comparing economic indicators such as Turkey's GDP, inflation rates, and consumer confidence with movie theater attendance data, I aim to uncover any correlations between economic conditions and the number of people going to the movies. 

The theater attendance dataset Iâ€™m using also distinguishes between Turkish and foreign audiences, allowing me to analyze whether economic growth affects tourists and locals differently in terms of the means they have for personal entertainment.

Data Collection:

Movie Theater Attendance Data:

Since both datasets contain yearly information, I will merge them based on the year as a common key. This will allow me to compare economic indicators with movie attendance for each corresponding year.
Once the data is combined, I will examine trends and correlations. For example:

If GDP grows, do more people go to the movies?

If inflation rises, does attendance drop?

If consumer confidence is low, do people spend less on entertainment?

This analysis could shed light on how economic conditions influence the time people devote to personal entertainment.
